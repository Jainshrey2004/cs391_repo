            <p>
                I’m a Computer Science student at Boston University passionate about building scalable products and
                systems that solve real world problems. With hands on experience in product management and full stack
                development, I’ve led cross functional teams to deliver AI driven platforms, internal tools, and user
                centric solutions for clients in banking and technology.
